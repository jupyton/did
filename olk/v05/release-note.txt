V03 release does the things below
1. on send, call onMessageSendHandler()
2. redact NRIC & Card Number
3. log the finding to RESTFUL API
4. then event.completed() to finish flow
5. add a info-only taskpane
6. partial redact rules
  6.1. all credit card detected will partial redact and keep last 4 digits only
  6.2. NRIC will keep 3 digits and check coded
  6.3. only correct check code will be redacted, wrong check code skip (no action)


purposely hard-coded blocking to avoid sending many email during testing
